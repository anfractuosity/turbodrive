# turbodrive

A portable floppy disk based music player.

To improve the quality of the .stl file generated, do the following:

```
Preferences > Part Design > Max deviation to: 0.0100mm
```

Alas the case did slightly split when inserting the drive, so for the next print I will need to increase the internal dimensions by around 2mm (this 
can be simply fixed in my Python code).
